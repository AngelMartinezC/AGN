# AGN
Codes to calculate Temperature and Density from the lines ratio of certain ions in the narrow line region of a given AGN

The python script takes into account the values from Osterbrock, 2006 


The script is based on the one written by de Robertis, Dufour, & Hunt (fivel.f). The paper explaining the fivel program can be found at Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada (ISSN 0035-872X), vol. 81, Dec. 1987, p. 195-220
